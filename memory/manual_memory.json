      "document": "The B.Eng. in Robotics and AI program is a four-year full-time undergraduate program. In order to graduate, the students must complete at least 131 credits. Students must achieve the required English proficiency level prior to the graduation and satisfy the graduation requirements. The program is designed to drive innovations and entrepreneurship in robotics and AI technology-related areas. Each semester will include a project- based theme which helps students practice and design innovative solutions in the respective areas. In the first year, the students study basic courses in mathematics and science and improve their communication skills. Students will also be introduced to fundamental programming concepts and the foundation of robotics systems. The first-year projects will give students hands-on experience, introduction and basic development of robotics technologies. In the second year, the students will learn advanced robotics concepts which serve as the foundation of robotics technologies. The students also learn to apply design methods for solutions in technical areas such as control systems design and kinematics and dynamics. Third-year students will learn about the latest technologies and AI which happen in the area. In each semester, the students will study new concepts and apply creativity in completing projects in trending areas such as machine perception application development, cognition and reasoning and IoT. Students will also learn about AI engineering, along with the process and tools to facilitate new innovations. Fourth-year students undertake significant RAI engineering capstone design projects. Students will apply their skills and knowledge to create sustainable innovations, practice open-ended engineering design and/or research that incorporates fundamental and advanced concepts in Robotics and AI. Students will learn to build innovation, identify the opportunities, propose ideas, design and implement innovative solutions while being able to apply standards and realistic engineering constraints. Students also further specialize in their areas of interest and prepare for the next step in their careers.",
